# My Website Learning Journey

This is my first small website, created as part of my learning journey in web development.  
It’s a simple webpage with a title and a paragraph, built using **VSCode**.  

I created this project in a GitHub repository to practice version control and track my progress.  
A big thanks to **Team Codingle** for guiding me and helping me learn the basics of building websites.  

This project is just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep improving and adding more features!
